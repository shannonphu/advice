title:  "Talking to Recruiters"
---

Try to stand out to recruiters by talking about what relevant work and project experience you've already done. I go about doing so with the following steps:
1. Firm handshake + introduction (name + major + year)
2. Hand your resume to the recruiter. They may be writing things on the back of your resume as you talk, but they are listening to you!
3. State what role you're looking for (ie software engineering internship)
4. Ask what opportunities their company has for that role and what the program is like
5. Then talk about your past experiences (past internship or projects you've done).
6. Ask meaningful questions about their internship program and company. Some good questions I always ask are: 
	* How does team/project placement work? 
	* How will the program provide mentorship for you? 
	* What have some past interns worked on?
